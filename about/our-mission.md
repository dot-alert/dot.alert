# Our Mission

**The Polkadot ecosystem is continuously evolving.**&#x20;

With this alluring novelty come a lot of unwanted risks: errors when transferring funds, incompatibility between account types, limited integration of cold wallets, bugs on experimental protocols, phishing on community forums, lack of clarity around legal obligations, etc.

[**Dot.alert()**](../) brings forth insights and must-have resources to guide Polkadot users throughout their journey.
