There are various avenues for obtaining assets ahead of **onboarding the Polkadot ecosystem**.

These include :

* Getting a [gift](https://gifts.polkadot.network/#/generate) (ex: Polkadot/Kusama vouchers)
* Getting a [tip](https://polkadot.com/treasury/), payout, or (child) bounty (ex: _Kappa Sigma Mu_ pot, Polkadot/Kusama Treasury bounties)
* Getting a [grant](https://web3.foundation/grants/) (ex: Polkadot/Kusama Treasury spends, W3F grants)
* Buying through fiat on-ramp on a webapp
* Swapping on a Decentralised exchange
* Swapping on a Centralised platform
* Buying/swapping on a Centralised exchange

You will need a Polkadot account to receive your coins/tokens, along with some understanding of the following concepts:

* Depending on the coins/tokens that you receive, you might need to pay attention to [existential deposits](existential-deposits.md).
* Depending on the dapps that you use, you might need to investigate [address formats](address-formats.md).
* Depending on the methods that you choose, you might need to make use of [transaction explorers](transaction-explorers.md).



**In this section, we review key information for sending, receiving, and transferring assets safely across Polkadot ecosystem's networks.**
