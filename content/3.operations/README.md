Being the custodian of your Polkadot assets gives you **access to various ecosystem platforms** for the following activities:&#x20;

* [join or launch](bidding/) collectives

* [crowdfund](crowdfunding/) for projects
* [stake](staking/) assets
* [swap](swapping/), [borrow](borrowing/), and [lend](lending/) assets
* [mint](nft-trading/data-management.md) and [sell](nft-trading/marketplace-activities.md) NFTs
* access [auto-compounding](auto-compounded-staking.md) and [listing](lbp-listing.md) services
* [create](gaming/game-assets.md) and [develop](gaming/game-development.md) gameverses

Nevertheless, operating on blockchain by your own means requires you to pay close attention to the underlying rules of the platforms that you use. This is because for each use case (ex: Governance, DeFi, Staking, etc.) there are multiple implementations (ex: forums, pools, rewards, etc.) available to users.&#x20;



**In this section, we look at how to optimise your interactions with various Polkadot network protocols and avoid signing your assets away.**
