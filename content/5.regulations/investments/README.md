# Investments

The Polkadot ecosystem is home to a growing diversity of projects that attempt to leverage third-generation blockchain technologies to build new financial and social systems.

Project teams can take advantage of special-purpose Web3 solutions that expand on traditional financial instruments to sustain themselves, create quality consumer-facing products, and establish their brand.&#x20;
