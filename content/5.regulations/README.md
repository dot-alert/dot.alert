# 5.Regulations

There are still a lot of legal unknowns in this ecosystem, because there are new protocols being coded every day and also because existing [protocols](../3.operations/) are being routinely upgraded. The range of testing environments provided ahead of deployment are mainly used by developers and a few tech-savvy project supporters, not by ordinary users nor regulators.&#x20;

In the Polkadot ecosystem, the **same asset can take on various forms** because of concepts such as:

* canary networks
* system chains
* remark tokens
* cross-chain transfers
* liquid crowdloans
* staking derivatives

Depending on jurisdictions, this modularity can introduce more complexity in regulatory risk management by the holders of parachain tokens.

In the end, **compliance** remains the biggest challenge for users, investors, project teams, and VC institutions alike.



**In this section, we cross-reference Polkadot network's technologies with existing legislations and review some essential ecosystem tools for assets management.**&#x20;
