## Web3 Interoperability with [_Hyperbridge_](https://hyperbridge.network/)

_15th July 2025 | A report by Adewumi V._



To date, more than $2 billion in crypto assets have been lost due to inefficient cross-chain communication. Since most blockchain infrastructure projects operate independently from each other; retail users and dApp developers often face major hurdles when attempting to transfer data or assets between networks. Addressing these gaps has therefore become crucial for unlocking a truly decentralised web.



**Which problems does&#x20;**_**Hyperbridge**_**&#x20;solve?**&#x20;

Hyperbridge is a next-generation interoperability coprocessor developed by Polytope Labs. It is built with the Polkadot SDK and designed to connect multiple blockchains. Hyperbridge takes a new approach to cross-chain connectivity by enabling the transfer of assets between blockchains without any intermediaries, with the goal of eliminating losses tied to insecure multisig bridges.&#x20;

Hyperbridge also deals with other key challenges hindering Web3 interoperability, such as costly on-chain verification methods and limited scalability. The platform benefits from a strong security layer inherited from Polkadot, which prevents the many governance or consensus attacks that are common in weaker bridge architectures.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Blog023_HyperbridgeMultichainTokens.PNG" alt="Hyperbridge Network supports both Solidity and Ink! smart contracts to enable multichain native tokens."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Who are the main users of&#x20;**_**Hyperbridge**_**?**

As a fully agnostic protocol, Hyperbridge allows developers to create secure cross-chain dApps that can interact with different types of blockchains and network operators.&#x20;

For end users, the main benefit is that they can enjoy faster and safer transactions that don’t involve trusting third parties. For example, withdrawals from Layer 2s are validated instantly and processed without delays.&#x20;

Additionally, Hyperbridge enables dApps and protocols to access pricing data, liquidity, and governance tools across multiple ecosystems securely. This also demonstrates that Polkadot's parachains (rollups) can be repurposed to provide functionalities for EVM chains.



**How popular is&#x20;**_**Hyperbridge**_**&#x20;in the industry?**&#x20;

Hyperbridge is currently the fastest-growing project within the Polkadot ecosystem. It supports various blockchains and rollups, including BNB Chain, Optimism, Gnosis Chain, and Mandala.&#x20;

## Web3 Usability with [_Osmosis_](https://osmosis.zone/)

_10th June 2025 | A report by Catherine N._



Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms often struggle with complex interfaces, slow transactions, and high fees, creating barriers for both new and experienced users. Osmosis, a decentralized exchange (DEX) within the Cosmos ecosystem, works around these hurdles by providing a user-focused trading experience for the Web3 industry.&#x20;



**Which problems does&#x20;**_**Osmosis**_**&#x20;solve?**

One of the key issues Osmosis addresses is cross-chain interoperability. In common setups, users must bridge assets manually before they become available for use. This is confusing, time-consuming, and very risky. Osmosis uses the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable automated and low-cost transfers across 100+ blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Polkadot, and Bitcoin. This eliminates friction to make users trade as if all their assets were on a single network.

The rigidity of liquidity pool structures seen in most DEXes often limits users' access to and control of their assets. Osmosis has introduced the concept of customizable liquidity pools, where liquidity providers can immediately adjust token weights, compositions, and fees through a simple interface.

Other major issues that deter users from engaging with DeFi are gas fees, transaction delays, and complex UIs. Through its Cosmos-based architecture, Osmosis pushes for low-cost and high-speed transactions, making DeFi trading more accessible for beginners and more responsive to experienced traders’ needs.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Blog022_OsmosisTokenPools.jpg" alt="Osmosis provides user-friendly and multichain  DeFi portfolio management tools."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Who are the main users of&#x20;**_**Osmosis**_**?**

Osmosis serves a broad audience which includes traders, [liquidity providers](../../content/3.operations/lending/liquidity-provision.md), and developers. Traders mostly stand to gain, with features that support transacting with assets across multiple blockchains. User feedback on Twitter and Reddit highlights the platform’s improved transaction staging and fair fees.

For liquidity providers, Osmosis gives the option to have greater control over investments with customizable pool parameters and real-time analytics. Developers can use Osmosis’s open-source framework to build decentralized applications (dApps), AMMs, yield aggregators, and NFT marketplaces, all with various cross-chain integrations. Builders praise Osmosis for its ease of use and powerful cross-chain tools.



**How popular is&#x20;**_**Osmosis**_**&#x20;in the industry?**

Osmosis has established itself as a leading DeFi platform, with $39+ billion in all-time trading volume and over 1 million active users. Its success is driven by full integration with the Cosmos ecosystem and other major networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
