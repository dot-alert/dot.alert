# World of Web3

## Web3 Utility with [_NOWPayments_](https://nowpayments.io/)

_13th May 2025 | A report by Adewumi V._



As businesses and individuals embrace blockchain technology, the need for secure and efficient payment solutions has increased. _NOWPayments_ is a gateway that bridges the gap between Web3 and traditional commerce by providing an easy-to-use platform for accepting cryptocurrency payments.



### Which problems does _NOWPayments_ solve?

One of the biggest hurdles to Web3 adoption is making cryptocurrencies easy to use. Accepting payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can be complicated due to technicalities such as wallet addresses and blockchain processes. NOWPayments proposes essential tech tools like APIs, plugins, and widgets, to empower businesses to accept over 300 cryptocurrencies with minimal effort.

Another challenge is price volatility. The value of cryptocurrencies can change rapidly, making it risky for businesses to accept them. NOWPayments offers an Auto Coin Conversion feature that instantly converts payments into stablecoins or any other cryptocurrency to mitigate financial uncertainty.

NOWPayments also seeks to enhance crypto security. The platform is non-custodial: users retain full control of their funds instead of relying on a third party. Unlike most payment processors which hold onto merchants’ crypto assets, NOWPayments allows direct deposits into the merchant’s wallet. The funds can be then used for various purposes like mass payouts.

Businesses such as online stores, casinos, travel companies, and gaming platforms use NOWPayments to offer decentralized payment options to their customers.  These businesses get access to fast, low-cost, borderless payments across multiple blockchain [networks](../../content/5.regulations/networks/).

Dapps developers integrate NOWPayments' API to facilitate secure crypto transactions on many ecosystems. The platform’s compatibility with multiple blockchain networks like Ethereum and Polkadot makes it a preferred choice for Web3 projects looking to add payment functionality without complex coding. With features like donation buttons and widgets, it becomes easier for freelancers, content creators, and Non-profit organizations to accept payments globally without traditional banking fees and delays.



### How popular is _NOWPayments_ in the industry?

Since its launch in 2019, NOWPayments has grown rapidly and is still onboarding new participants to the blockchain industry.
