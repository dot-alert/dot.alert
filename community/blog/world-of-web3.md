# World of Web3

## Web3 Accessibility with [_WalletConnect_](https://walletconnect.network/)

_11th March 2025 | A report by Adewumi V._



User experience (UX) is a crucial element of Web3, shaping how users interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and services. As Web3 expands, intuitive and accessible UX is essential to keep pace with its rapid growth and evolving regulations.&#x20;



### Which problems does WalletConnect solve?

In a decentralized ecosystem where users have greater control over their data and transactions, UX must be designed to help users navigate these complexities. _WalletConnect_ plays a key role by simplifying interactions and reinforcing security across multiple platforms.&#x20;

_WalletConnect_ is an on-chain UX ecosystem that addresses a major User Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DX) challenge in Web3: the disconnect between desktop-based dApps and mobile wallets. WalletConnect provides a universal and secure way for users to connect their wallets to dApps via QR codes or deep links.

Beyond refining accessibility, composability, and connectivity, WalletConnect also ensures mobile compatibility, multi-wallet support, and cross-chain interactions. It simplifies authentication with one-click “Sign-In With Ethereum” (SIWE) and reduces friction in KYC.

### Who are the main users of _WalletConnect_?&#x20;

_WalletConnect_ serves everyone in the industry: UX designers, developers, and end users. UX designers can improve onboarding with authentication tools, while developers can use the SDK to integrate multi-wallet support into dApps. _WalletConnect_’s SDK is well-maintained and easy to use, because developers do not have to build separate solutions for each wallet.

End users also benefit from encrypted wallet-dApp interactions. Many users have praised _WalletConnect_ online for being safer than browser extensions or desktop wallets. By fostering collaboration across these groups, the project helps make Web3 intuitive, robust, and truly decentralized for everyone.



### How popular is _WalletConnect_ in the industry?

_WalletConnect_ is one of the most widely used on-chain UX solutions in Web3, serving retail users on both mobile devices and desktops. It is chain-agnostic and supports EVM networks (including Layer 2s), as well as the Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, and Bitcoin ecosystems.&#x20;

By prioritizing accessibility and interoperability, _WalletConnect_ works to redefine on-chain interactions for all. To date, it has enabled over 150 million connections for 24 million users. The platform has also integrated 600+ wallets and over 40,000 dApps to establish itself as a leading solution for improving user experience in the decentralized web.&#x20;
