The PTF operates on-chain via the Collectives chain and off-chain through the Fellows repository. It’s a merit-based group where members are ranked by the depth of their knowledge and hands-on contributions to Polkadot SDK and its ecosystem.

Members are expected to uphold the Manifesto’s core principles, follow its governance processes, and actively maintain the codebase over long periods of time. Progression is hard-coded: your rank depends on the quality and impact of your technical work.

**Application**: Submit motivations and GitHub contributions.\
**Induction:** Get seeded by a Fellow.\
**Retention:** Show consistent work.\
**Promotion:** Pass evaluations and in-person interviews.\
**Demotion**: If inactive or unproductive.
