_6th November 2025 | A thread by Pooja G._



**Want to grow professionally in Web3 while making a real impact?** The [Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship](https://www.notion.so/dotambassadors/1c979191f39e80428450d803b8f12c31?v=1c979191f39e817481d2000cca886b05) (PAF) brings more than a community. It’s a structured path to leadership, learning, and career opportunities.&#x20;

The PAF is a decentralised, community-led program built on DIRECT principles: Dynamic, Inclusive, Resilient, Equitable, Clear, and Trustless. It’s designed to support and grow the Polkadot ecosystem through active engagement.

Polkadot ambassadors can progress through 6 ranks by contributing to online education, governance, events, content creation, and leadership. This Fellowship gives real visibility, mentorship, and meaningful connections to members across continents.
