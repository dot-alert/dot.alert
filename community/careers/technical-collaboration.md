# Technical collaboration

## Build open source projects.

_19th June 2025 | A thread by Pooja G._



**Developers, an opportunity awaits!** Polkadot’s [Open Source Developer Grants Bounty Program](https://github.com/PolkadotOpenSourceGrants) is now accepting applications for innovative projects! Build the future of Web3 with funding of up to $30K.

This community-guided initiative aims to onboard up to 15 promising open-source projects to expand the ecosystem. Unlike traditional funding routes, this program streamlines the grant process with milestone-based payments and expert curator oversight.

The program specifically targets individuals and small teams with proven experience in open-source development. Whether you're building proofs of concept, general-purpose libraries, or dApps, the bounty is there to offer support!



Here is a glimpse of the application process:

* Submit your proposal in the GitHub repository
* Include project scope, technical specifications, and sustainability plan
* Outline milestones with key deliverables
* Demonstrate how your project addresses ongoing issues

Want to maximize your chances? Focus on solving real ecosystem needs, demonstrate prior open-source contributions, and lay out specific milestones. The review process emphasizes technical feasibility and long-term value for Polkadot stakeholders.

For all approved projects, payments are released after successful milestone delivery. This structure ensures that funds go to teams that are actively building while maintaining transparency throughout the development process.
