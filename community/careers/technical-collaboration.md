# Technical collaboration

## Develop JAM client implementations.

_21st  August 2025 | A thread by Pooja G._



**Exploring high-level technical roles in Web3?** [Decentralized JAM](https://jam.web3.foundation/) by Web3 Foundation offers a clear path for blockchain engineers to contribute meaningfully within the Polkadot ecosystem, where creativity meets open source impact.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Thread16.1 (1).PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



So, what is Decentralized JAM (aka JAM Prize)? It's an initiative focused on supporting exceptional talent to build the future of Polkadot technologies: the "Join-Accumulate Machine" (JAM).

The JAM Prize is about developing a new foundation for the decentralized web. As the proposed successor to the Relay chain, JAM introduces a minimal and scalable base layer for all Web3 operations. This is your opportunity to help reinvent the network from the ground up!

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Thread16.2.PNG" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



Technical contributions can be submitted across diverse programming languages such as:

* Java, AspectJ, Kotlin, C#, Go
* Haskell, ML, Perl, Python, Ruby, JS, Groovy, Dart
* Brainfuck, Whitespace, Redstone

Who should apply? Protocol engineers, system designers, researchers, and builders who thrive on solving hardware and software problems. Teams are expected to deliver key technical milestones throughout.

## Provide decentralised infrastructure services.

_24th July 2025 | A thread by Pooja G._



**Power your Polkadot & Kusama projects with global infrastructure excellence!** The [Infrastructure Builders Program (IBP)](https://ibp.network/) connects ambitious builders with world-class node operators delivering decentralized high-performance services.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Thread14.1.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



The IBP brings together a distributed network of infrastructure providers, from the USA through to Costa Rica, Nigeria and South India. This worldwide coverage ensures optimal performance regardless of where users are located.

The program offers three core infrastructure services: RPC endpoints maintaining 99.9% uptime, boot #nodes operating with <100ms responses, and indexer nodes providing worldwide coverage.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXermTKBrzSukwHNXvOD-aJpNeiQLFO-1UqHUWfB3b1dbOjn38UondV4JNQkSGGNwttVBkR848PHeO_bT5o2-zMFkFi66GjcyPo7nQ--Hue1nqEVjZio6rKRykgxx53PBqMCmMrv?key=VOzvQ3b_Ax64NWAWS4IfxLwo" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The IBP follows 5 key principles:

* Decentralization —closer to users
* Autonomy —independent operators
* Robustness —enterprise-grade equipment
* Reliability —redundant systems
* Sustainability — powered by 100% renewable energy



The program features members that are ranked based on their undertakings. Professionals like Gatotech, Turboflakes, RadiumBlock, and Dwellir bring enterprise-level reliability, while Hobbyists contribute to diversifying the set of operators.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXewfEKEApt2dD_MVIRn7HY3jQzJgX8L3KehsNUY73DMhPFBHwtZCxerLfJfb2D1odpErhriotS8OaEw1bnSDhrOuyBYwdd0YsCOLa_Aqku7iNB2a7x_5jd_Nk4nSXQ_ZNBdm0JJ3g?key=VOzvQ3b_Ax64NWAWS4IfxLwo" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The IBP prioritizes resilience through independent data centers, standalone hardware, and special-purpose monitoring systems. These setups ensure that dApps never experience unexpected downtime.

## Support network services.

_10th July 2025 | A thread by Pooja G._



Attention node operators! The [System Parachains Collator Bounty](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties/32) supports essential infrastructure providers with monthly rewards of $300 in DOT and KSM!

This initiative addresses a critical need by incentivizing infrastructure builders to maintain System chains like AssetHub, BridgeHub, and Coretime. This is because, unlike regular rollups, system chains generate minimal transaction fees.&#x20;

The bounty is structured around performance and reliability. Collators receive monthly fixed rewards, with distribution based on their block production ratio. This model is in place to guarantee high-quality service for all system chains.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXchnhZJ4FKTBvegS-E3MP7hPxemJRfvTQIzDT01xiQy-loX6_3JcpKJl6MwDjhdS68Vd8bFoPn9anOuvcy0l_uDfOKejWgJkN2y868M7zDtzmBxUMZ77csO7dyUPgsgIxze-51Y0Q?key=8rwc_RexwhKVN2BdE4mj7tUS" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here are the steps for becoming eligible as a permissionless collator:

* Deposit 1,000 DOT or 50 KSM
* Register as a collator candidate&#x20;
* Demonstrate consistent performance over time



Monthly evaluations enforce transparency. Collators receive payments based on previous month's achievements and all metrics are publicly available. This data-driven approach benefits those who contribute the most to network reliability.

Important note: The bounty is only a temporary solution, as the ecosystem is still working towards more sustainable long-term funding models. Its main role is to make sure that System chains can maintain optimal performance.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfpvO75O8hOtVLk6PRJDzjy5BimMO-qh-MZ1lmBuQeDOhcmPWrHH3rFfpAmfVbCNVyq97PicabymhW1VhlK_haHr-BQi2JAlI4QgklwiWVxTRjZfMUeYQbQCqKOXRBXoVuQqmbqGg?key=8rwc_RexwhKVN2BdE4mj7tUS" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
