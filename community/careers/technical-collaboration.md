_8th May 2025 | A thread by Pooja G._

What exactly is OpenGuild? It's a movement of passionate Web3 builders contributing to open-source projects across Southeast Asia. With members spanning Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, this initiative is truly a regional powerhouse!

Their impact is real: OpenGuild has distributed over $20,000 in bounties and celebrated 20 graduates fresh from the prestigious [Polkadot Blockchain Academy](blockchain-education.md#get-formal-blockchain-training). This community doesn't just talk about Web3 - they're actively building it!

Want to see what OpenGuild members are creating? From PolFT (an Interchain Gaming NFT Leasing platform) to GmGN (a super-fast wallet using Passkeys), these doers are building practical solutions for everyday Web3 challenges using Polkadot technologies.



The community truly shines in hackathons. In the Polkadot Vietnam Hackathon 2025, OpenGuild members dominated across multiple tracks - NFT, PayFi, DeFi, and UI/UX. Their creative problem-solving and technical know-how is generating a lot of enthusiasm beyond digital spaces.
