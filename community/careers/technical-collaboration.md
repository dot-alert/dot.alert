_22nd May 2025 | A thread by Pooja G._



**Transform your coding journey with** [**Kudos**](https://www.morekudos.com/): where blockchain developers find their perfect match! If you have ever dreamed of seamlessly connecting with Web3 projects that align with your skills, letâ€™s see how Kudos can empower you to contribute!&#x20;

Kudos is an intelligent matchmaking platform designed specifically for the Polkadot ecosystem. By bringing together talented developers and cutting-edge projects, it creates the perfect environment for incubation and growth.

Picture yourself browsing through opportunities that align with your skills and interests. Whether you're experienced in Rust, Ink!, or TypeScript, Kudos will help you discover relevant projects without endless GitHub searching.

For developers, the benefits are clear: find projects that match your expertise and work on meaningful contributions. Polkadot projects can tag contributions with custom rewards: native tokens, NFTs, and POAPs. This setup turns interest for coding into tangible benefits.



Kudos is also pioneering a concept called "Agile Devtime" to allow projects to quickly scale their workforce when needed. This approach is effective when responding to new grants or polishing existing features, so that core developers can focus on strategic initiatives.

## Hack on Polkadot SDK.

_8th May 2025 | A thread by Pooja G._



**Discover** [**OpenGuild**](https://openguild.wtf/)**!** A thriving community that's elevating projects, connecting talent, and building the decentralized future - one step at a time.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Thread9.1.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



What exactly is OpenGuild? It's a movement of passionate Web3 builders contributing to open-source projects across Southeast Asia. With members spanning Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, this initiative is truly a regional powerhouse!

Their impact is real: OpenGuild has distributed over $20,000 in bounties and celebrated 20 graduates fresh from the prestigious [Polkadot Blockchain Academy](blockchain-education.md#get-formal-blockchain-training). This community doesn't just talk about Web3 - they're actively building it!

Want to see what OpenGuild members are creating? From PolFT (an Interchain Gaming NFT Leasing platform) to GmGN (a super-fast wallet using Passkeys), these doers are building practical solutions for everyday Web3 challenges using Polkadot technologies.



The community truly shines in hackathons. In the Polkadot Vietnam Hackathon 2025, OpenGuild members dominated across multiple tracks - NFT, PayFi, DeFi, and UI/UX. Their creative problem-solving and technical know-how is generating a lot of enthusiasm beyond digital spaces.

Here are some benefits on offer in this initiative:

* Connect with 3,500+ passionate builders
* Participate in regular knowledge-sharing events
* Contribute to 50+ open-source projects
* Earn XP for community participation

Ready to level up your Web3 journey? OpenGuild welcomes builders of all levels. Check out their Community Handbook at [openguild.wtf](https://openguild.wtf/) to get started. Remember: in Web3, building together is where the magic happens.
