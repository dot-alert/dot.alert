_23rd January 2025 | A thread by Pooja G._



**Building the Future of Web3 Events!** Discover how the [Events Bounty](https://dotevents.xyz/) is uplifting community gatherings through dedicated event funding.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Thread4.1.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The curators of the Events bounty understand that meaningful connections happen face-to-face. That's why they're actively supporting event organizers who are keen to bring the community together.

What makes this initiative special? More than money, it’s helping community leaders grow. Each event plays an important role in making local and global Polkadot communities stronger.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcLxgRgOLZ_b1bXzwRq_UerGoNyL-wcc1XXbrHE1koPkjKWAzPAsmCbGqWteEl5Ha4C-0ffh6QuWII-RIhfSA3S3k-i04hDZQngEyGBlkkuzSl2v3epo-kjWU2hZCuRkse-8EgGxw?key=CKIYZOz0mT-0q45y3TAONP8p" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Wondering what kind of events qualify?  This initiative supports various formats:

* Local community meetups
* Technical workshops
* Regional conferences
* Educational seminars



The Events bounty provides clear guidelines. From submitting an EOI to tracking your final proposal, event organizers are mentored at every step. Curators have been selected to provide valuable insights throughout and empower community managers to deliver impactful events.

Why is the Events bounty’s approach remarkable? It goes beyond [funding](../../content/3.operations/community-building/crypto-payments.md) by offering applicants a comprehensive set of resources to ensure the success of their proposals. This includes detailed guides for your planning and direct interactions with experienced community members.&#x20;

Remember: regardless of size, any event contributes to the growth of the Polkadot ecosystem. Whether you're setting up your first workshop or your tenth conference, your gathering matters for a more connected community.&#x20;

## Set up a meetup.

_9th January 2025 | A thread by Pooja G._



**Want to organize a Polkadot meetup?** Here's something exciting: you can get up to 1000 USD in $DOT to cover your costs with the [Meetups bounty](https://dotmeetup.notion.site/Meetups-bounty-cd57b5990ba443559413dec3b339ab4a)! Let's break down this bounty program.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Thread3.1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Important note: The bounty works as a post payment. You organize the meetup first, then apply for a reimbursement. The program is designed to support genuine community builders who are already active in the Polkadot ecosystem.&#x20;

Before diving in, make sure you have contributions to show as a Polkadot community member. Not quite there yet? No worries! Get involved in the ecosystem first: [build your presence](../../content/3.operations/community-building/crypto-communities.md) and consider which audience you will target for a meetup. Quality matters more than quantity.&#x20;



Thinking of applying? The process is simple: organize your meetup, keep all invoices for venue hires, record all catering costs, and submit your proposal after the event. The community keeps track of all submissions and outcomes on a public dashboard.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Thread3.2.PNG" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Need guidance? DOTmeetups participants are very active on social channels. Connect with experienced organizers, ask questions in preparation of your future proposals, and get valuable insights. Focus on building meaningful connections.&#x20;

Documentation is key! Each proposal needs:

* Event details
* Costs breakdown
* Photos and videos
* Social media coverage

Here's a pro tip: Before planning your meetup, thoroughly review all guidelines. Common reasons that see a proposal rejected include insufficient documentation and failure to meet basic requirements for community engagement. Make your effort count!&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcqxQO9oYGDYhLWH8wMjpgL2UN5oWpW_e9h5kaf400zjWml9jxOZ6fmqJ9TcKN8Hu7xCJ9QdMbubClXyC2exPrcJoP5OXvvvTvJ-8oC2fXgk9uhQcHAuaABA3KYmoBVoq-3xZscGA?key=IWOpCYdK41mebVZCHv0ogIlp" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Get started as a community organiser with [DOTmeetups.xyz](https://t.co/mSsKjrPV8p). Remember: building local communities is crucial for Web3 adoption, and your meetup could be the spark that ignites future innovations!&#x20;
