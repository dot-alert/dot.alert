This is a dedicated force working 24/7 to keep the Polkadot ecosystem safe and secure.&#x20;

Let's talk about Anti-Phishing. The Anti-Scam team actively scans websites and [social platforms](../../content/4.social-support/) for suspicious activities. They're like security cameras for the Polkadot ecosystem, constantly watching for fake sites, misleading links, and potential threats to your assets.&#x20;

Looking at the numbers: In 2024 alone, this team tracked 13,103 bad actors, with 10,718 targeting the Polkadot ecosystem at large. They stand at an impressive 92.7% takedown rate! That's over 9,900 threats neutralized to keep your assets safe. &#x20;

The team is building a comprehensive database of DNS registrars, streamlining the fight against dangerous websites, and exploring new strategies to combat emerging threats. Bonus: an exciting collaboration with [ChainPatrol](https://chainpatrol.io/) is in the works!

Outreach is key! The Anti-Scam crew doesn't work in isolation. They collaborate with various partners to spread awareness about scams. This is a true neighbourhood watch program for the entire Polkadot community!&#x20;

Got questions or concerns? Their social channels are your direct line to security updates. Follow their X profile for real-time alerts and check out their YouTube channel for detailed safety guides. All their resources are free and accessible.&#x20;

## Promote positive interactions.

_6th March 2025 | A thread by Pooja G._



**Let's explore an exciting opportunity in the Polkadot ecosystem - The** [**Moderation bounty**](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties/24) **program!** If you're passionate about Web3 and community building, this could be your gateway to a rewarding role.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Thread7.1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The story begins with passionate agents who stepped up to assist and guide new users. These individuals started without compensation, driven purely by their commitment to Polkadot's vision. Their journey from volunteers to recognized ecosystem contributors is truly inspiring.

What exactly do moderators do? They're the guardians working 24/7 to:

* Guide newcomers around
* Maintain positive discussions
* Keep spaces productive
* Relay latest developments

The impact of their work is immense. With 11 team members working across different time zones and [social channels](../../content/4.social-support/) to ensure the community never sleeps. Whether you're an intern seeking guidance or a newcomer exploring Polkadot, moderators are there to help!

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Thread7.2.PNG" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



To recognize the moderation team’s valuable efforts, there is a set compensation scheme. The annual plan allocates funding for 15 hours per week per moderator, acknowledging that community support is a serious responsibility requiring time and expertise.

Compensation for Polkadot moderators is performance-based. Monthly rewards depend on peer assessment ratings and impactful contributions. This approach ensures accountability and high-quality [community management](../../content/3.operations/community-building/).

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf0N9zMICWL0dRn3EKRJuU4C3dbQ1rGXWuZIWQ3AFZmEzFPJjuSVqnfEz-WmG80Vy-OA0Q3Nq91qV_9K6em4bwkEEN6fhhkZZiRb9xZn20qNkpx2jXzRSGW40y8K_zX1-KylP2_gQ?key=Ur_HstWNuTvR5hPj8zyicfS2" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

One of the key features of this bounty is its dynamic nature. As the community grows, the bounty evolves to meet the increasing demands of a diverse user base. This investment in community support shows how seriously Polkadot takes its user experience.

What makes this initiative special? More than money, it’s helping community leaders grow. Each event plays an important role in making local and global Polkadot communities stronger.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcLxgRgOLZ_b1bXzwRq_UerGoNyL-wcc1XXbrHE1koPkjKWAzPAsmCbGqWteEl5Ha4C-0ffh6QuWII-RIhfSA3S3k-i04hDZQngEyGBlkkuzSl2v3epo-kjWU2hZCuRkse-8EgGxw?key=CKIYZOz0mT-0q45y3TAONP8p" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Set up a meetup.

_9th January 2025 | A thread by Pooja G._



**Want to organize a Polkadot meetup?** Here's something exciting: you can get up to 1000 USD in $DOT to cover your costs with the [Meetups bounty](https://dotmeetup.notion.site/Meetups-bounty-cd57b5990ba443559413dec3b339ab4a)! Let's break down this bounty program.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Thread3.1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Important note: The bounty works as a post payment. You organize the meetup first, then apply for a reimbursement. The program is designed to support genuine community builders who are already active in the Polkadot ecosystem.&#x20;

Before diving in, make sure you have contributions to show as a Polkadot community member. Not quite there yet? No worries! Get involved in the ecosystem first: [build your presence](../../content/3.operations/community-building/crypto-communities.md) and consider which audience you will target for a meetup. Quality matters more than quantity.&#x20;



Thinking of applying? The process is simple: organize your meetup, keep all invoices for venue hires, record all catering costs, and submit your proposal after the event. The community keeps track of all submissions and outcomes on a public dashboard.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Thread3.2.PNG" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Need guidance? DOTmeetups participants are very active on social channels. Connect with experienced organizers, ask questions in preparation of your future proposals, and get valuable insights. Focus on building meaningful connections.&#x20;

Documentation is key! Each proposal needs:

* Event details
* Costs breakdown
* Photos and videos
* Social media coverage

Here's a pro tip: Before planning your meetup, thoroughly review all guidelines. Common reasons that see a proposal rejected include insufficient documentation and failure to meet basic requirements for community engagement. Make your effort count!&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcqxQO9oYGDYhLWH8wMjpgL2UN5oWpW_e9h5kaf400zjWml9jxOZ6fmqJ9TcKN8Hu7xCJ9QdMbubClXyC2exPrcJoP5OXvvvTvJ-8oC2fXgk9uhQcHAuaABA3KYmoBVoq-3xZscGA?key=IWOpCYdK41mebVZCHv0ogIlp" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Get started as a community organiser with [DOTmeetups.xyz](https://t.co/mSsKjrPV8p). Remember: building local communities is crucial for Web3 adoption, and your meetup could be the spark that ignites future innovations!&#x20;
